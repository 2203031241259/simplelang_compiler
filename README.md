# SimpleLang Compiler for 8-bit CPU

## 📌 Overview
SimpleLang is a minimal high-level programming language designed for educational purposes.  
This project implements a **basic compiler** that translates SimpleLang source code into **assembly code** compatible with an **8-bit CPU simulator**.

The compiler helps in understanding:
- Lexical analysis
- Parsing
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Code generation
- Basics of computer architecture

## 🧠 SimpleLang Features
- Variable declarations (`int a;`)
- Assignments (`a = 10;`)
- Basic arithmetic (constants and variables)
- Sequential execution
- No loops (intentionally simple)
